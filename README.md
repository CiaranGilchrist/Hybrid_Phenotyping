# Hybrid_Phenotyping
This repository includes R code for analysing high-throughput hybrid phenotyping data. <br />
This is based on data generated for Chapter 3 of my doctoral thesis, but it may be adapted for other projects. <br />
**File S1.R** is the R code for generating plots and data files from parental population phenotyping data
**File S2.R** is the R code for generating plots and data files on F1 heterosis and F2 transgression
**File S3.R** is the R code for analysing data files generated from **File S1.R** and **File S2.R**
*Note that File S3.R needs files generated from the other two files*
